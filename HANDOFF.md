## Entry 001

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Updated by:** Claude
**Phase:** Pre-build — Architecture Lock and Schema Planning
**Session type:** Architecture Review + Schema Planning

### Current Project State
v2.0 is a clean-slate rebuild of Northgate HQ on a locked architecture.
v1 (`Northgate-HQ`) remains intact as a working backup — do not touch it.
All infrastructure is new and separate from v1.

### Infrastructure
- GitHub: `RNSolutions-electrical/Northgate-HQ-v2.0`
- Supabase: New project — same naming scheme as repo
- Netlify: New deployment — v1 remains live separately
- Clerk: Shared with v1 — same publishable key
- Google Sheets: `Northgate HQ — Master Data Workbook` (ID: `1mD_d0tyZy1wEuJtxIkTyRhL9cy-s1PchH6-3OOL7L94`)

### Documents in This Repo
- `HANDOFF.md` — this file, cumulative session log
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Architecture Lock Document v2.1, authoritative
- `docs/INVENTORY_SCHEMA.md` — Inventory Schema Plan v2.3, ready for SQL

### What Has Been Decided (Full Summary)
**AI Roles:** Claude = architecture reviewer/drift detector. Codex = implementation
driver/debugger. Architecture Lock Document = source of truth. Ryan = final authority.
Mid-build trigger: pause for Claude review if a decision affects schema, relationships,
module boundaries, permissions, audit logging, snapshots, source-of-truth rules,
financial logic, inventory logic, or cross-module communication.

**Primary entity naming:** Jobs (not Projects). Table is `jobs`. Nav item is "Jobs."
Project Management is a feature set within a Job, not a separate entity.

**Core architectural rules (non-negotiable):** Inventory balances transaction-derived
only; Jobs are source of truth after creation; approved estimate snapshots immutable
(DB trigger); permissions server-authoritative; audit logging cannot be bypassed; Dev
Console actions always logged; no duplicate source-of-truth; no direct DB edits outside
controlled tools; cost at time of transaction always stored; change orders are financial
records not documents; per-line-item transaction destinations from day one; physical
locations vs transaction destinations are distinct; archive over delete; snapshot
immutability DB-enforced.

**Cost structure order (locked):** Material markup → Overhead → Profit (independent
percentages, sequential).

**Permissions:** Roles — Developer, Administrator, Project Manager, Estimator, Field
Supervisor, User (Field Tech). Flags: see Architecture Lock Document Section 17.

**Google Sheets:** Master Data Workbook is the bulk data entry interface. App UI handles
one-off edits for authorized users. Supabase is the live source of truth — Sheets is not.

**Data in the Google Sheet (as of this entry):** Materials — hundreds of live rows with
full cascade (broad_category → sub_category → sub_category_2 → sub_category_3 → size);
Employees — real team data; Vehicles — E-101 (2019 Chevrolet Express 2500); Cost Codes —
Northgate Division 16 electrical codes; Assemblies — E-REC-001; Inventory Levels — bins
A111, C211–C224 with real stock data.

**Known data cleanup needed before import:** Material_Categories has blank field_name on
some sub_category_2 rows; Cost_Codes code `16,050.00` needs to be plain text `16050`.

### What Was Completed in Pre-Build
- Architecture Lock Document v2.1 finalized
- AI Development Roles document finalized
- Inventory Schema Plan reviewed across versions (v1 → v2.1 → v2.2 → v2.3)
- All schema conflicts with Phase 1 resolved: material_code kept as canonical key;
  4-level cascade kept as text columns; Phase 1 table names kept; vehicle_bins restored;
  min_quantity added to bin_items; Clerk user IDs locked as TEXT; target_quantity added
  to transaction_items; change_logs column names locked to Phase 1; void_expired_carts()
  replaces pg_cron (free tier).
- Repository named Northgate-HQ-v2.0; new Supabase project to be created.

### Next Steps (in order)
1. Codex generates migration SQL from docs/INVENTORY_SCHEMA.md (v2.3)
2. Ryan creates new Supabase project and runs migration SQL
3. Codex sets up v2.0 repo structure and base React + Vite app
4. Codex wires Clerk auth and Supabase client
5. Codex builds inventory cart checkout workflow
6. Claude does architecture alignment check before cart system build
7. Update this HANDOFF.md after each step

### Open Questions / Concerns
None currently blocking. Schema is locked and ready for SQL generation.

### Architecture Drift Warnings
None active at this time.

## Entry 002

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Updated by:** ChatGPT
**Phase:** Migration Review — Inventory Balance Finalization
**Session type:** Cross-model implementation review / fresh-session handoff

### Current Active Repository
Correct working repo: `RNSolutions-electrical/Northgate-HQ-v2.0`.
Do NOT use `RNSolutions-electrical/Northgate-Estimator-V2.0` — that was a repo-name
confusion during a previous session. GitHub access confirmed for the correct repo.

### Migration Review Status
Codex generated the first full Phase 1 Inventory migration. ChatGPT reviewed and found
the original `update_inventory_balance()` trigger mishandled physical count corrections
(summed all `physical_count_correction.target_quantity` values instead of treating the
latest approved correction as a new baseline). Codex revised. Claude flagged two concerns:
UUID ordering is not chronological and should not be a ledger tie-breaker; pending and
rejected rows should not affect official balances. Both accepted.

### Locked Migration Adjustments Since v2.3
- `transaction_items` must include `ledger_sequence BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`
- Index: `idx_txn_items_bin_status_ledger ON transaction_items(bin_item_id, status, ledger_sequence)`
- `update_inventory_balance()` uses only `status = 'approved'` rows
- pending/rejected rows stay in log but do not affect `inventory_balances.quantity`
- A physical_count_correction becomes baseline only when `status = 'approved'`
- Latest correction selected by `ORDER BY ledger_sequence DESC`
- Cart checkout/finalization must explicitly mark inventory-moving rows `approved`

### Required Next Claude Review
Does approved-only balance align with lock document? Is ledger_sequence the correct
ordering mechanism? Should checkout mark rows approved immediately? Does separating
transaction-log status from job-cost approval need to be added to the lock document?

### Important Architectural Concern
There is now a likely distinction between inventory movement approval and
job-cost/accounting approval. Current migration uses a single `transaction_items.status`.
If inventory is physically finalized but job-cost approval is still pending, one status
may not be enough long-term. Working assumption: `status = 'approved'` means inventory
movement is official and affects on-hand balance; job-cost approval may need a separate
future field/table/status. Review before building cart checkout.

### Architecture Drift Warnings
Do not let pending/rejected rows affect balances. Do not use UUID order for sequencing.
Do not merge physical movement approval with accounting/job-cost approval without explicit
architectural decision. Do not run the migration until Claude completes final review.

## Entry 003

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Updated by:** Codex
**Phase:** Phase 1 Inventory Migration Revision
**Session type:** Migration update / architecture alignment

### Decisions Applied This Session
- Inventory cost valuation invariant preserved: every job-cost effect valued at catalog
  unit_cost at the moment of transaction, stored in `unit_cost_at_time`, signed by direction.
- App job-cost remains partial by design — internal-stock movements only. Direct/AP
  purchases that never enter stock do not touch the app.
- `transaction_items.status` remains physical-only. `approved` means the physical movement
  is official and affects on-hand balance. It does NOT mean job-cost, accounting, AP,
  invoice, or reconciliation approval.
- `ledger_sequence` remains a deterministic tie-breaker, not real-world event order.
- `occurred_at` introduced as physical movement event time, distinct from `created_at`.

### Migration Changes Made
- Added `ledger_sequence BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` on transaction_items.
- Added `occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to transaction_items.
- Added constraint preventing approved rows from having null occurred_at.
- Updated `update_inventory_balance()`: serialize recomputes per bin_item_id via
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock`; calculate from approved rows only; select latest count
  correction by `occurred_at DESC, ledger_sequence DESC`; sum approved movements after
  the latest correction; keep corrections as baselines not additive; recalc both old and
  new bins if bin_item_id changes; sort/dedupe affected bin IDs before locking to prevent
  deadlocks.
- Added minimal canonical `vendors` table.

### Checkout / Finalization Requirements
Mark physical movement rows approved when stock physically moves; stamp `occurred_at = NOW()`;
snapshot `unit_cost_at_time` from catalog at moment of issue/return; do not use
`transaction_items.status` for any financial/accounting approval.

### Still Requires Final Review
Revised migration prepared but must be reviewed by Ryan/ChatGPT before running. Do not run yet.

## Entry 004

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Updated by:** Codex
**Phase:** Phase 1 Inventory Migration File Generation
**Session type:** Migration artifact creation / pre-run review

### What Was Completed
Created the Phase 1 Inventory SQL migration file:
`supabase/migrations/202605310001_phase_1_inventory.sql`. Generated from
docs/INVENTORY_SCHEMA.md v2.3 plus the approved Entry 003 balance-trigger revisions.
Included approved-row-only balance calc, occurred_at ordering, ledger_sequence tie-breaker,
per-bin advisory locks, sorted/deduped lock order, corrections as baselines, the minimal
vendors table, occurred_at, ledger_sequence, approved-row constraint, balance indexes, cart
tables, vehicle stock tables, utility functions, triggers, and the Grand Master Inventory view.

### Important Notes
Supabase CLI not installed in workspace, so the file was created directly using the
timestamped migration filename convention. Migration NOT yet run. Requires final review.

---

## Entry 005

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Updated by:** Codex
**Phase:** Phase 1 Inventory Migration Runtime Fixes
**Session type:** Migration review fix / pre-run review

### What Was Completed
Updated `update_inventory_balance()` in both the migration file and
docs/INVENTORY_SCHEMA.md so trigger code only references OLD/NEW in valid operations.
Replaced the affected-bin subquery with explicit TG_OP branches: INSERT uses
NEW.bin_item_id; DELETE uses OLD.bin_item_id; UPDATE uses both. Kept sorted/deduped
advisory-lock order by unnesting the affected-bin array. Updated `block_snapshot_mutation()`
so DELETE returns OLD and UPDATE returns NEW.

### Important Notes
Migration NOT yet run. Still requires final Ryan/ChatGPT review before execution.

---

## Entry 006

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Updated by:** Codex
**Phase:** Phase 1 Inventory Migration Applied
**Session type:** Supabase migration execution / post-run verification

### What Was Completed
Confirmed projects: v1 backup `northgate-hq / qpbuzinkjbjbvcdwvdfu`; v2 target
`northgate-hq-v2.0 / keogysnoukbendfkfjcn`. Confirmed v2 migration history empty before
applying. Applied the reviewed Phase 1 Inventory migration to the v2 project only.
Supabase recorded it as version `20260531173603`, name `phase_1_inventory`. Ran
post-migration balance tests with temporary `codex-test-*` records, then cleaned them up.

### Verification Completed
Pending insert did not affect balance; updating to `approved` with occurred_at affected
balance; approved physical_count_correction reset the baseline; approved movement after
correction adjusted from the new baseline; rejected rows did not affect balances; zero
remaining codex-test-* rows after cleanup.

### Important Notes
Migration run only against v2 (`keogysnoukbendfkfjcn`). v1 backup not selected, not modified.

### Next Steps
Begin wiring the app to v2 Supabase when Ryan is ready. Build cart checkout/finalization so
physical movements set `status = 'approved'`, `occurred_at = NOW()`, `unit_cost_at_time` =
current catalog cost. Import/seed real inventory data after Google Sheets cleanup.

## Entry 007

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Updated by:** Claude
**Phase:** Phase 1 Inventory — Post-Migration Architecture Review
**Session type:** Architecture Review (mid-build trigger: inventory balance + status semantics)

### What Was Reviewed
Reviewed the applied Phase 1 migration (Entries 003–006) against the Architecture Lock
Document. Focus: ledger_sequence / approved-only balance behavior and the
`transaction_items.status` semantics flagged for Claude review in Entry 002.

### Findings
**Technical implementation — approved, no changes needed.** ledger_sequence is the correct
deterministic ordering mechanism. occurred_at separated from created_at is correct and was
a good addition not in the v2.3 plan; backdated-entry handling via
`occurred_at DESC, ledger_sequence DESC` is sound. pg_advisory_xact_lock per bin with
sorted/deduped lock order is proper concurrency safety. Approved-only balances and
physical-count-correction-as-baseline logic fix the original additive bug.

**Architecture decision resolved — status semantics.** The shift of
`transaction_items.status` from "job-cost approval" (original Section 14) to "physical
movement approval" (implemented) is CORRECT. Physical movement and accounting approval are
genuinely separate events with different reviewers and timing. They cannot share one field.

### Decisions Made This Session
- `transaction_items.status` = physical movement approval only. Approved by Ryan.
- Job-cost/accounting approval = separate mechanism, reserved for Financials phase. When a
  transaction has `destination_type = 'job'`, it will generate a separate job-cost entry
  with its own approval lifecycle. Not built now.
- Lock document updated: Section 14 rewritten as "Two Distinct Approval Concepts"
  (14a/14b/14c). Constitutional rules 15 and 16 added.

### Lock Document Changes
- Section 14 "Pending Job Cost Review" → "Two Distinct Approval Concepts" with subsections
  for physical movement (14a), reserved job-cost approval (14b), app job-cost scope (14c).
- Constitutional rule 15: physical movement approval and accounting approval never merged.
- Constitutional rule 16: only approved rows affect balances; ordering uses occurred_at with
  ledger_sequence tie-breaker, never UUID order.

### What Codex Needs to Know
Migration as applied is architecturally sound — no rework. `transaction_items.status` is
physical-movement-only; do not use it for accounting meaning when building cart checkout.
Cart checkout sets `status = 'approved'`, `occurred_at = NOW()`, `unit_cost_at_time` =
catalog cost at issue/return. Do not build the job-cost approval mechanism yet.

### Next Steps (in order)
1. Codex builds inventory cart checkout/finalization (unblocked)
2. Resolve Google Sheets cleanup before import
3. Import/seed real inventory master data into v2 Supabase
4. Wire app to v2 Supabase project
5. Update HANDOFF.md after cart checkout is built

### Architecture Drift Warnings
CARRIED FORWARD (now resolved): "Do not merge physical movement and accounting approval" —
resolved this session, promoted to constitutional rule 15. Closed.
ACTIVE: When the Financials phase builds job-cost approval, it must use a separate
field/table — never repurpose `transaction_items.status`.

## Entry 008

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Updated by:** ChatGPT
**Phase:** App Bootstrap / Netlify Deployment Recovery
**Session type:** Front-end wiring, repo repair, deployment troubleshooting
**Note:** This entry was originally mislabeled "Entry 007." Corrected to 008.

### What Was Completed
Confirmed working repo `RNSolutions-electrical/Northgate-HQ-v2.0`. Confirmed Phase 1
migration already applied and verified in v2 Supabase. Began front-end wiring after finding
app folders existed but several core files were missing/empty/incorrect. Fixed Netlify build
failures in sequence: missing root `package.json`; invalid `vite.config.js` (contained
package JSON instead of Vite config); missing `src/App.jsx`; missing
`src/hooks/usePermissions.js`; Netlify serving old 404 deploy instead of latest successful
deploy. Confirmed preview deploy worked. Published to production. Confirmed production URL
works: `https://northgate-hq-v2.netlify.app/`.

### Files Confirmed / Created / Repaired
`package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `index.html`, `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`,
`src/services/supabaseClient.js`, `src/hooks/usePermissions.js`, `public/_redirects`.
App shell includes Clerk provider, signed-out landing, sign-in button, signed-in dashboard
shell, UserButton, temporary permissions hook, Supabase client init check.

### Current App State
App builds and deploys successfully. UI is a temporary starter shell, NOT the final
interface. Current dashboard cards: Dashboard Shell, Clerk Auth, Supabase Client. The
temporary permissions hook hardcodes role `Developer`, division `Admin`,
`canAccessDeveloper: true`, `canManageInventory: true`, `canViewFinancials: true`. Temporary
only — must be replaced with server-authoritative permissions.

### Important Netlify Notes
Production: `https://northgate-hq-v2.netlify.app/`. The production 404 was caused by the
successful deploy not being published, not by repo code. Settings: build `npm run build`,
publish `dist`, production branch `main`.

### Important Warnings
Do not treat current `usePermissions.js` as real security — temporary scaffold only.
Permission enforcement must become server-authoritative per the lock document. Do not build
inventory checkout until Clerk auth, Supabase connectivity, and app shell behavior are
confirmed in production. The app currently only proves the deployment shell works; it does
not yet prove DB reads/writes or Clerk-to-Supabase user mapping.

### Next Steps
Manual production test (landing, sign-in, dashboard, UserButton, Supabase card). Add a real
Supabase health/read test. Replace temporary permission scaffold with a proper
user/permission lookup. Add module layout/navigation shell. Begin Inventory module UI
(catalog read view, storage hierarchy browser, cart scaffold, checkout/finalization). Before
checkout/finalization, confirm with Claude that the status / physical-vs-accounting approval
separation is still aligned.

### Architecture Drift Warnings
Temporary front-end permissions hook is not compliant as a final permission system. Do not
allow client-side permission checks to become authoritative. Do not confuse successful
deployment with completed app functionality. Inventory checkout must create physical movement
rows with `status = 'approved'`, `occurred_at = NOW()`, `unit_cost_at_time` = current catalog cost.

---

## Entry 009 — ALIGNMENT / SYNC POINT

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Updated by:** Claude
**Phase:** Cross-model sync before Inventory UI build
**Session type:** Reconciliation — single source of truth reset

> Purpose: get both models and Ryan on the same page before further building.
> If anything below conflicts with an earlier entry, THIS entry and the
> Architecture Lock Document win. Read this first.

### Entry Numbering Correction
Two entries were both labeled "Entry 007." Corrected: Entry 007 = Claude post-migration
review (2026-06-02). Entry 008 = ChatGPT app bootstrap (2026-06-02, was mislabeled 007).
Entry 009 = this sync point. Going forward: read the last entry number and increment, never reuse.

### Current State of Truth (confirmed facts)
**Infrastructure:** Repo `RNSolutions-electrical/Northgate-HQ-v2.0`; v2 Supabase
`northgate-hq-v2.0 / keogysnoukbendfkfjcn`; v1 backup `northgate-hq / qpbuzinkjbjbvcdwvdfu`
(untouched); production `https://northgate-hq-v2.netlify.app/`; Netlify build `npm run build`,
publish `dist`, branch `main`.
**Database:** Phase 1 Inventory migration APPLIED and verified in v2 only. Version
`20260531173603` / `phase_1_inventory`. Balance behavior tested and passed.
**App:** Builds and deploys. Current UI is a temporary starter shell, NOT final. Clerk
provider, signed-out landing, sign-in, dashboard shell, UserButton, Supabase init check working.

### What Is LOCKED (do not revisit without lock document update)
1. `transaction_items.status` = physical movement approval ONLY (Section 14a + Rule 15).
2. Job-cost/accounting approval = separate mechanism, reserved for Financials phase (14b).
3. Only `approved` rows affect `inventory_balances`; ordering uses occurred_at +
   ledger_sequence, never UUID order (Rule 16).
4. Cart checkout sets `status='approved'`, `occurred_at=NOW()`, `unit_cost_at_time` = catalog cost.
5. All 14 original constitutional rules plus rules 15, 16, 17 are in force.
6. The status-semantics review ChatGPT requested in Entry 008 step 6 is ALREADY DONE
   (Entry 007). Does not need repeating.

### What Is TEMPORARY and MUST Be Replaced
The `usePermissions.js` scaffold hardcodes Developer / Admin / full access. Violates
Constitutional Rule 4. Acceptable only as deployment bootstrap. Corrections required:
- The real server-authoritative hook already exists from Phase 1 (reads user_permissions by
  Clerk ID, caches, auto-creates row with safe defaults). RESTORE it — do not write a new system.
- Until restored, flip the default from full-access to LEAST privilege. Full access is the
  most dangerous possible default.

### Required Action — Documents Out of Sync
Claude's Entry 007 updated the lock document (Section 14 rewrite, rules 15-16; rule 17 added
in this session). If the repo's `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` lacks these, push the updated version
now. Both models must read the same lock document.
Checklist:
- [ ] Updated ARCHITECTURE.md (Section 14 rewrite + rules 15, 16, 17) in repo
- [ ] HANDOFF.md entries renumbered (007 Claude, 008 ChatGPT, 009 this)
- [ ] This full HANDOFF.md committed to repo

### Agreed Next Steps (in order — hard gate noted)
1. Push updated ARCHITECTURE.md and this reconciled HANDOFF.md to repo.
2. Manual production smoke test: landing → sign-in → dashboard → UserButton → Supabase init.
3. Add a real Supabase health/read test (harmless table or view).
4. **HARD GATE:** Restore the real server-authoritative `usePermissions` hook and confirm
   Clerk → Supabase user mapping. Nothing that writes to the DB is built before this.
   Read-only catalog view MAY proceed in parallel.
5. Add module layout/navigation shell.
6. Inventory module UI: (a) catalog read view — OK now, read only; (b) storage hierarchy
   browser; (c) cart scaffold; (d) checkout/finalization — ONLY after step 4 clears.
7. Resolve Google Sheets cleanup before real data import (blank field_name rows; cost code
   `16,050.00` → `16050`).
8. Update HANDOFF.md after each step.

### Open Questions / Concerns
None blocking once documents are synced and the permission hook is restored.

### Architecture Drift Warnings (active)
- ACTIVE: Temporary usePermissions scaffold hardcodes full access. Restore to
  server-authoritative before any write-capable UI. Default must be least-privilege if it remains.
- ACTIVE (Financials phase): Job-cost approval must use a separate field/table — never
  repurpose `transaction_items.status`.
- CLOSED: "Don't merge physical movement and accounting approval" — resolved Entry 007,
  promoted to Constitutional Rule 15.

## Entry 010

**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Updated by:** Claude
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Inventory) — concurrent UI/platform architecture decision
**Session type:** Advisory / architecture decision — mobile & UI strategy

### Context
Ryan asked, in general terms, about (a) offline-capable apps, (b) shipping native
apps to the app stores, and (c) the React Native vs Flutter vs Capacitor trade-offs.
Northgate HQ itself was confirmed to remain ONLINE-based — Supabase is the live
source of truth; HQ is not an offline-first design. Out of that discussion Ryan made
two forward-looking UI/platform decisions for Northgate HQ.

### Decisions Made This Session
- **Responsive web UI is a foundational build requirement.** The Northgate HQ web app
  must be built mobile/tablet-responsive from the first screen, not desktop-only.
  Rationale: the HQ UI has not been built yet, so designing responsiveness in now
  avoids costly retrofit later (consistent with the "design before build" principle).
  — Approved: Ryan.
- **React Native companion app added as a reserved future phase.** A native,
  app-store-distributed companion app focused on field-inventory workflows (QR
  scanning, stock/vehicle lookups, on-site job-usage logging, push notifications),
  reading from and writing to the same Supabase source of truth as the web app. Built
  only after core HQ is stable. — Approved: Ryan.

### Why the Companion App Is Low Architectural Risk
Supabase already exposes the API and enforces auth/RLS, so the companion app is almost
purely a new front-end against the existing back-end. No second database, no sync
layer, no separate server. Server-authoritative permissions (Constitutional Rule 4)
continue to apply to the second client. This fits the Scope Control Rule (Section 28):
preserve the clean path now, build later.

### Lock Document Changes
- Bumped to **v2.2**.
- Section 26 "Mobile and Desktop Behavior" expanded: added Ryan's Decision on
  responsive-from-the-start as a foundational requirement (explicitly distinct from
  the user-customizable layout presets in Section 27, Phase 4), and added a "Future
  Phase — React Native Companion App (reserved, not now)" subsection documenting the
  companion app's architecture and constraints.
- No constitutional rules added. The responsive baseline is documented as a Section 26
  build requirement. Ryan may elevate it to a numbered Constitutional Rule (Rule 18) in
  a future update if he wants it carried with that weight.

### Schema Changes
None this session.

### What Codex Needs to Know
- When the HQ UI is built, build it responsive from the start — phone/tablet layouts
  are a foundational requirement, NOT a Phase 4 add-on. Basic responsiveness is not the
  same as the customizable layout presets in Section 27, Phase 4.
- Do not start the React Native companion app yet. It is a reserved future phase.
- The companion app, when built, must use the same Supabase project and the same
  server-authoritative permission checks — never a separate data store or a permission
  bypass.

### What Claude Needs to Know
- Mobile/UI strategy is now documented in Section 26 (v2.2). Future reviews touching UI
  build order should confirm responsiveness is being designed in from the start.
- Verified this session: the live repo's `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` already contains the
  Section 14 rewrite (Two Distinct Approval Concepts, 14a/14b/14c) and Constitutional
  Rules 15, 16, 17. The Entry 009 checklist item "Updated ARCHITECTURE.md in repo" is
  therefore satisfied.

### Next Steps (in order)
1. Push this v2.2 ARCHITECTURE.md and this HANDOFF.md (Entry 010) to the repo.
2. HARD GATE unchanged (from Entry 009): restore the server-authoritative
   `usePermissions` hook and confirm Clerk → Supabase user mapping before any
   write-capable UI. Read-only catalog view may proceed in parallel.
3. Continue the Inventory module per the Section 29 build order.
4. Resolve Google Sheets cleanup before real data import (blank field_name rows; cost
   code `16,050.00` → `16050`).
5. Update HANDOFF.md after each step.

### Open Questions / Concerns
- Does Ryan want the responsive-from-the-start requirement elevated to a numbered
  Constitutional Rule (Rule 18), or is its placement in Section 26 sufficient? Left in
  Section 26 pending Ryan's call.

### Architecture Drift Warnings
- CARRIED FORWARD (active): Temporary `usePermissions` scaffold hardcodes full access.
  Restore to server-authoritative before any write-capable UI; default must be
  least-privilege if it remains. (From Entry 009.)
- CARRIED FORWARD (active, Financials phase): Job-cost approval must use a separate
  field/table — never repurpose `transaction_items.status`. (From Entry 009.)
- NEW (advisory, future companion-app phase): When/if the React Native companion app is
  built, it must not become a path around server-authoritative permissions and must not
  introduce a second source of truth. Carry forward until the companion app phase begins.
